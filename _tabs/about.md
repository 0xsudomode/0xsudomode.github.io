Hey folks,

I go by the name sudomode on the internet , a 23 years old cybersecurity enthusiast. Around 2015, I got into reverse engineering, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to the world of web applications.
After snagging my CCNA badge, I decided to really dive into cybersecurity. I hopped on CTF platforms to sharpen my skills, and now I’m all about bug hunting and penetration testing. It’s become more than a passion – I’m looking to turn it into a full-blown career in web app hacking.
So, yeah, that’s a bit about me. I’m stoked about the idea of securing digital spaces and am always up for a good challenge. Looking forward to what’s next!
